# RainyDays - JS1 Course Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains the **JavaScript 1 Course Assignment**, which builds upon the previous **HTML & CSS** course assignment. The goal is to enhance the existing **RainyDays** online store by incorporating JavaScript to fetch and display products dynamically from an API. Users will be able to browse products, filter them, add/remove items from their basket, and complete a checkout process.

## Goal
Using JavaScript, create an **interactive online store** that fetches product data from an API. Users should be able to interact with the site by adding items to their basket and completing a purchase.

## Features & User Stories
- ✅ **Homepage:** Displays a list of products fetched from an API.
- ✅ **Product filtering:** Users can filter products by **category, gender, or genre**.
- ✅ **Product details:** Clicking on a product leads to a page with detailed information.
- ✅ **Shopping basket:** Users can add and remove items from their basket.
- ✅ **Checkout page:** Users can view their cart summary before completing the purchase.
- ✅ **Order confirmation:** After checkout, users see a confirmation message.

## Required Pages
To complete the assignment, the following pages must be implemented:
- 🏠 **Home Page** (`/index.html`) - Displays the product list.
- 🛍 **Product Page** (`/product/index.html`) - Shows product details.
- 🛒 **Checkout Page** (`/checkout/index.html`) - Displays cart contents before purchase.
- ✅ **Confirmation Page** (`/checkout/confirmation/index.html`) - Shows a thank-you message.

### Optional Pages (for extra realism)
- 🔍 **Category Pages** (e.g., Outdoor Jackets, Men's/Women's Clothing, Movie Genres)
- 📜 **Terms and Conditions** (AI-generated content is acceptable)
- 🔐 **Privacy Policy** (AI-generated content is acceptable)
- 👤 **User Profile**

## Development Process
1. Decide whether to **use the existing RainyDays project** or start fresh.
2. Open the project in **GitHub Desktop and VS Code**.
3. Choose **one of the three provided APIs**:
   - 🌧 **Rainy Days API** (Outdoor clothing)
   - 🎮 **GameHub API** (Video games)
   - 🎬 **Square Eyes API** (Movies)
4. Review the **API documentation**.
5. Implement each JavaScript requirement **one step at a time**.
6. Test the website thoroughly and ask for peer reviews.
7. Review at least **two other students' projects**.
8. Make final refinements before **submission**.

## Important Features
- **Error Handling:** Alert users if an API call fails.
- **Loading Indicators:** Show feedback while data is being fetched.
- **No Hardcoded Data:** All product data must come from the API.
- **Accessibility Compliance:** The site must be usable and interactive.
- **Modern Asynchronous Code:** Use `async/await` instead of `.then()`.
- **Clean Code:** Remove all `console.log` statements before submission.

## Delivery Requirements
- 📂 **GitHub Repository:** The JavaScript code should be committed to the `main` branch.
- 📄 **Reflection Document:** A short write-up about the project development process.
- 🌍 **Live Demo:** Deployed version on **Netlify or GitHub Pages**.
