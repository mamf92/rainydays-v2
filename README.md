**RainyDays v2** is the upgraded version of a fictional online store built as the **JavaScript 1 Course Assignment**. It enhances the original HTML & CSS project by adding dynamic product fetching from an API, interactive features like filtering and shopping cart functionality, and a partial checkout experience.
